# Machine Learning for stock price prediction

## Project Overview
The stock price prediction project aims to predict the prices of stocks. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to achieve accurate prediction.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the yahoo finance dataset for British American Tobacco from the 7th of June 2004 to 6th of June 2024

### Features
The dataset contains the following features:

1. Date
2. Open: Open stock price that day
3. High: The highest price that day/daily high price
4. Low: The lowest price that day
5. CLose: The closing price
6. Adj Close: The adjusted stock price after taking dividends, stock splits, and others into consideration
7. The volume of stocks traded that day

## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files and directories:

- data/: Directory containing the dataset files.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- src/: Source code for the project, including data processing and model training scripts.
- results/: Directory to save results, such as evaluation metrics and plots.
- README.md: This README file.
